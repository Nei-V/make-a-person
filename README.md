Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:

    getFirstName()
    getLastName()
    getFullName()
    setFirstName(first)
    setLastName(last)
    setFullName(firstAndLast)

Run the tests to see the expected output for each method.

The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument and it has to be a string.

These methods must be the only available means of interacting with the object.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
